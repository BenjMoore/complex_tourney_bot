ravenString = """```Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore‚Äî
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
‚Äú‚ÄôTis some visitor,‚Äù I muttered, ‚Äútapping at my chamber door‚Äî
Only this and nothing more.‚Äù

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;‚Äîvainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow‚Äîsorrow for the lost Lenore‚Äî
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore‚Äî
Nameless here for evermore.

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
‚ÄúSir,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúor Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you‚Äù‚Äîhere I opened wide the door;‚Äî
Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ‚ÄúLenore?‚Äù
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ‚ÄúLenore!‚Äù‚Äî
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
‚ÄúSurely,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúsurely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore‚Äî
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;‚Äî
‚ÄôTis the wind and nothing more!```‚Äù"""

My boss caught me watching a hottub streamer during work and he squeezed my hog so hard and wouldn't even stop after I banned him.

I've seen PerlAU play, he doesn't even use a monitor. He visualizes the map in a detailed rendering, completely in his mind. He has a biological wallhack; his godlike perception highlights all enemies within light-years. His eyes are closed as his mouse gracefully swerves across the table, making immaculate twitches as he flicks from head to head. The bullets that escape his gun barrel are surgical; each making a deadly strike in between his opponent's eyes.

global wikiShitpostingString
wikiShitpostingString = """In Internet culture, shitposting or trashposting is the act of using an online forum or social media page to post content that is satirical and of "aggressively, ironically, and trollishly poor quality", an online analog of trash talk.[1][2][3][4][5][excessive citations] Shitposts are intentionally designed to derail discussions or cause the biggest reaction with the least effort, and are sometimes made as part of a co-ordinated flame war to make a website unusable by its regular visitors.[6]

Definition and usages
Shitposting is a modern form of online provocation. The term itself appeared around the mid-2000s on image boards such as 4chan, but the concept is not new; the early 20th-century art movement Dadaism created art that was intentionally low-quality or offensive to provoke the art world.[7][8] Writing for Polygon, Sam Greszes compared shitposting to Dadaism's "confusing, context-free pieces that, specifically because they were so absurd, were seen as revolutionary works both artistically and politically". Greszes writes that the goal of shitposting is "to make an audience so confused at the lack of content that they laugh or smile".[9]

Professor Greg Barton, an expert on terrorism at Deakin University, said that racist shitposting is common across the internet and is a way for people to connect and gain attention. He said, "The thing about social media is that it's social. You want some feedback, you want people to like your stuff whether it's Instagram or Facebook. Shitposting is all about getting your profile up, getting a response and the more ironic and funny you can be the more you get."[10][11]"""
